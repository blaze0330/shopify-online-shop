Shopify Summer 2019 Developer Intern Challenge Question

## Getting Started
This webserver is built on Rails 4.0.6 and Ruby 2.3.0
Assuming you have the correct Ruby version installed:
1. Fork this github repo and go to the application's main directory
2. Install the required gems by running the bundler

        $  bundle _1.3.0_ install
Note: a higher version of the bundler might not work, just in case, use the bundler at version 1.3.0

3. Start the web server:

        $ rails server

The server is now started at `http://localhost:3000` and you will be able to call the API following the below documentation.
